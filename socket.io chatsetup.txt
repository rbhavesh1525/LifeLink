step1 : go in app.js install socket.io , import server from socket.io 
crarte connection io.connect and disconnection io.disconnection


step2: after doing basic setup build frontend and make connection with socket.io  using io.on for connect and socket.on for disconnect in backend
* install library which allow frontend to communicate or get connect with backend
* npm i socket.io-client
* import in frontend

* then connect with backend url 
check terminal for connection


* then create ui name and room id 
take 2 states for them two store their values

* create one joinroom function in this function 
check first username and room should have data 
then do socket.emit("join-room",data) data means id of room 

on server side 
handle this event join room and do 

 socket.on("join_room",(data)=>{
        socket.join(data); 
        console.log(`user with id: ${socket.id} joined room: ${data}`)
    });


and when you are sending request from frontend to backend no http request getting created this is the beauty of socket.io
